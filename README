Ubigraph version 0.01
======================

Ubigraph is a Perl client interface for the UbiGraph software 
(http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph/) with object-oriented abstraction
over the XML-RPC calls. UbiGraph is a client-server software for
3D visualization and layout of graph-theoretical network diagrams.
This module hides the XML-RPC calls and allows visualization through
object-oriented access to Vertex and Edge objects, similar to 
Python and Ruby APIs.

For the details of the parameters, users should refer to the UbiGraph
XML-RPC Manual (http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph/content/Docs/index.html).


Example:

    use Ubigraph;

    my $u = new Ubigraph();

    my $v1 = $u->Vertex();
    my $v2 = $u->Vertex(shape=>"sphere");

    my $e1 = $u->Edge($v1, $v2);

    $v1->shape("torus");
    $v1->size(3.5);

    sleep(2);

    $u->clear();

    my @v;
    for (0..100){
        $v[$_] = $u->Vertex();
    }

    for (0..100){
        $u->Edge($v[int(rand(100))], $v[int(rand(100))]);
        select(undef, undef, undef, 0.05);
    }
